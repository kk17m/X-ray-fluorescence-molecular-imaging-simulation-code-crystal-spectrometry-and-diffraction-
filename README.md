# X-ray-fluorescence-molecular-imaging-simulation-code-crystal-spectrometry-and-diffraction-
A Monte Carlo simulation code for high resolution X-ray fluorescence (xrf) imaging using crystal Bragg diffraction. Simulation includes energy dispersive photon counting detectors intended for medical molecular imaging. Mice model for in vivo fluorescence based radiological imaging and tomography using nanoparticle contrast agents.
